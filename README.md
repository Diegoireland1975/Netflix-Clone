# Landing Page - Netflix-Clone
This is a Netflix clone. The layout is a bit of a mix between the original Layout, and a tutorial I found on Youtube.
I tried to stick as much as I could to the original layout but I added something that it's not in the original website.
My approach it's always mobile first, starting for mobile and applying media queries for tablet and desktop.
I used Grid and Flexbox for the layout.
I add the functionality to the accordions with Javascript.
I inserted the looping videos exactly like in the original layout. 
I downloaded the photos from the original website, then I positioned them relative and I positioned the videos absolute.
Technologies used:
HTML, CSS3, JS, Cssgrid, Flexbox
